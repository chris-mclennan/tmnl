# Draft a release-announcement newsletter on Buttondown from a tagged
# release. Reads the matching version's section out of CHANGELOG.md,
# wraps it in a friendly preamble, creates a DRAFT email via the API.
# You review + send from buttondown.com — this script never actually
# fires the send. Editorial control stays with you.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/send-release-newsletter.sh v0.1.2
#
# Requires:
#   BUTTONDOWN_API_KEY in env (already a GitHub secret on each repo;
#   set locally for one-off use:  export BUTTONDOWN_API_KEY=…).
#
# What it does:
#   1. Pulls the version's section from CHANGELOG.md.
#   2. POSTs a new email with status="draft" to Buttondown's API.
#   3. Prints the URL where you review + hit Send.
